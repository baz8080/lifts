"""No page script may redeclare a global from statusui's shared bundle.

The bundle is inlined ahead of each page's own script, so a redeclaration
silently shadows the shared helper on that page alone.

The names come from `statusui.js_globals()`, never from reading `ui.js`: the
bundle is two files since the caption listener moved to `caption.js`, and a
test that reads one of them passes by seeing fewer names - which is a guard
failing open, silently, exactly when it stops covering something.
