# Publishing: what makes the page current, and what only looked like it did

Decisions behind the collector's push slots, the site build's trigger and the
staleness threshold. Dated 2026-09-02, with the run times that settled them.

## The banner blamed the wrong half - 2026-09-02

The page read `Updated 22 hours ago - collection has stopped` while `lifts-data`
held data from nine hours earlier. Collection had not stopped. The build had.

The wording is gone (statusui's `freshness()` no longer takes a `note`, and this
repo's station-page sub line no longer appends one), because it was an inference
the page is in no position to make: from the browser, a build that stopped and a
collector that stopped look identical. What survives is the age and the red.

That left the real fault, which the wording had been papering over.

## The age on the page is the age of the data, not of the build

Worth stating because it is the thing that makes the obvious fix wrong.
`freshness()` measures from the collection horizon against the reader's clock,
so rebuilding the site later cannot make the number smaller. Moving the build
into the morning does nothing for a reader at 09:00 if the build carries
yesterday's noon data either way. Only two things move the number: pushing more
often, and building promptly after a push the site has not yet seen.

## The cron was not running when it said it would - 2026-09-02

`pages.yml` asked for `40 5` and `40 12` UTC. What GitHub actually ran, over the
week to 2026-09-01, identical in this repo and in esb:

| Cron | Actual run start, UTC |
|---|---|
| `40 5` | 10:24, 10:39, 11:46, 11:48, 13:38, 16:46, 17:41 |
| `40 12` | 16:51, 16:53, 16:56, 19:13, 22:33, 22:36 |

Four to ten hours late, every day, and the morning slot never once landed in the
morning. Before 2026-08-26, with a single `40 5` cron, runs started 05:58-06:06Z:
18 to 26 minutes late, which is the normal jitter GitHub documents. Push- and
dispatch-triggered runs are unaffected - the 2026-09-01 merge built at 21:18Z,
seconds after the push. Only `schedule` events are throttled this way.

Worked through, that is exactly the reported string: the 10:24Z build saw data to
23:22Z, the 16:53Z build saw data to 11:19Z, nothing built after it, and at 09:47
IST the next morning that horizon is 21.5 hours old.

**Retiming the cron was rejected.** A four-to-ten-hour delay cannot be aimed at a
one-hour window; picking a better cron time only moves where the miss lands.

## The build is triggered by the data landing - 2026-09-02

`lifts-data` now carries `.github/workflows/build-site.yml`, which on every push
calls this repo's `pages.yml` through its existing `workflow_dispatch`. The site
rebuilds within a minute of the data arriving, and the two crons stay on as the
fallback for a dispatch that never fires.

`workflow_dispatch` rather than `repository_dispatch`: `pages.yml` already
declares the trigger, so the site repo needed no new one, and the fine-grained
token needs only **Actions: write** instead of the **Contents: write** that
`repository_dispatch` requires. The token lives in `lifts-data` as
`SITE_BUILD_TOKEN`; the Pi's own credential is an SSH deploy key and cannot call
the API, so firing the dispatch from `backup-to-git.sh` would have meant putting
a second, wider credential on the Pi.

The fallback crons are `0 7` and `0 14` UTC. Actions cron has no timezone and DST
shifts Dublin by exactly one hour, so for a one-hour local target window only the
hour boundaries land inside it in both seasons: 07:00Z is 07:00 local in winter
and 08:00 in summer, 14:00Z is 14:00 and 15:00.

## Six-hourly pushes, and a threshold that can trip - 2026-09-02

`lift-status-backup.timer` moved from `00,12` to `00,06,12,18` local. The site is
only ever as current as the last push, so this is what caps how old the page can
look. Worst case is ~7h: a 6-hour slot, up to 30 minutes of `RandomizedDelaySec`,
and up to one 30-minute poll interval between the last poll and the push. The old
twice-daily slots put that at ~13h, which is why the page could show half a day
even when everything was working.

`STALE_AFTER` went from 16h to 10h to match. 16h was sized for the twice-daily
gap; under a six-hourly cadence it would only fire after more than two
consecutive pushes were missed, which is not a warning. 10h clears the ~7h
legitimate maximum with room and flags a single missed push (13h+) within a few
hours of it happening.

**Two pushes a day shifted to 07:00 and 19:00 local was rejected.** It keeps the
commit volume, and the mean age across 08:00-22:00 works out at ~5.4h against
~6.4h for the midnight/noon phase, but the peak stays at ~12h. Six-hourly gets
the mean to ~3.2h and the peak to ~7h for two more commits a day against a
repository that exists to be appended to.
